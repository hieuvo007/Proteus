# Proteus Electronic Simulations

## 📘 Overview
Welcome to the **Proteus Simulation Repository**. This project serves as a comprehensive collection of electronic circuit designs and simulations developed using the **Proteus Design Suite**. Ideally suited for students, engineers, and hobbyists looking to understand circuit logic and power electronics.

## 🚀 Repository Structure
The project follows a strict Git flow structure:
- **`main`**: Contains the stable versions and high-level documentation.
- **`dev`**: The default development branch for integration.
- **`feature/*`**: Experimental branches for specific circuit modules (e.g., H-Bridge, Sensors).

## ⚡ Featured Projects
- **H-Bridge Motor Driver**: Advanced DC motor control using Complementary MOSFET pairs (P-MOS & N-MOS) to ensure efficiency and safety.
- **Light Sensor System**: Analog sensing circuit using BJT transistors for automatic switching.
- **Logic Analysis**: Fundamental tests for digital logic gates and signals.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Software**: Proteus Design Suite 8.x
- **Simulation Engine**: SPICE / ProSPICE
